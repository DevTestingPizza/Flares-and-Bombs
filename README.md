# Flares and Bombs

Fully working helicopter countermeasures and plane bombs in FiveM.

How to use:
1. Get a compatible plane or helciopter.
2. Give it the proper vehicle mods for countermeasures or bomb installations.
3. Follow the prompts that appear on screen when you're flying those vehicles.


When using the bomb option, as soon as you open the bomb bay doors the plane will fly for you. You won't be able to fly the plane yourself until you close the bomb bay doors again.
